    <h1>TimelessWords - Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: March 17, 2023</p>
    <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the TimelessWords mobile application (the "Service") operated by TimelessWords ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
    <p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</strong></p>
    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly or annually), depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.</p>
    <p>At the end of each period, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.</p>
    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or other payment methods, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>We may, at our sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
    <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by us until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
    <p>At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>Our Service allows you to interact with AI-generated content that simulates conversations with historical figures. All content is generated using artificial intelligence and should not be considered historically accurate. The content does not represent the actual views, opinions, or beliefs of any historical figure.</p>
    <h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms, or any other purpose not reasonably intended by TimelessWords.</p>
    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of TimelessWords and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of TimelessWords.</p>
    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall TimelessWords, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.</p>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
