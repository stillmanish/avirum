        <h2>AI-Related Terms</h2>
        <h3>AI-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>This app uses Claude AI from Anthropic to generate responses from historical figures. All conversations are AI-generated and represent interpretations of historical figures based on available information about them. The accuracy and authenticity of responses cannot be guaranteed.</p>
        <h3>API Usage</h3>
        <p>The app connects to Anthropic's Claude AI API. By using this app, you acknowledge that your conversations may be processed by Anthropic's systems in accordance with their privacy policy and terms of service.</p>
        <h3>Content Limitations</h3>
        <p>While we strive to provide historically authentic responses, the AI may occasionally produce content that is historically inaccurate or anachronistic. The app should not be used as a primary historical reference source.</p>
        <h3>Content Moderation</h3>
        <p>The AI has built-in safeguards to prevent harmful content, but we cannot guarantee that all generated content will be appropriate. If you encounter inappropriate content, please report it immediately.</p>
