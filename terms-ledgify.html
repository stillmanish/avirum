                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">By downloading, installing, or using the Ledgify app ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">2. Description of Service</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">Ledgify is a personal finance tracking application that allows users to record, organize, and analyze their financial transactions. The App provides features such as: natural language transaction entry, AI-powered receipt scanning and data extraction, transaction editing and categorization, financial summaries and CSV export, optional automated bank-transaction import via Plaid, and iCloud sync for data backup. The App is intended for casual, personal, and small business use only. It is not a substitute for professional accounting, tax, or financial advice.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">3. User Responsibilities</h2>
                            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                                <li>Accuracy: You are solely responsible for reviewing, editing, and ensuring the accuracy of all transactions and data entered or imported into the App, including those processed by AI.</li>
                                <li>AI Limitations: The App uses artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and categorize data from receipts and natural language input. AI systems may occasionally make mistakes, misinterpret data, or behave unpredictably. You must review and correct all AI-generated entries.</li>
                                <li>Data Security: You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and your Apple ID. Do not share your login credentials with others.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">4. AI and Automated Features</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">The App uses AI and machine learning models to process receipt images and natural language text. While we strive for high accuracy, AI-generated results may be incomplete, incorrect, or misleading. You must review and verify all AI-generated or imported transactions. Automated bank-transaction import is provided through Plaid. By connecting a bank account you agree to Plaid's End User Privacy Policy (https://plaid.com/legal). Plaid may access and transmit your financial information; Ledgify only receives the data necessary to populate your ledger and does not store your bank credentials.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">5. No Financial, Legal, or Tax Advice</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">The App is not a financial, accounting, or tax service. It does not provide financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. The App is intended for tracking and organizational purposes only. You should consult a qualified professional for any financial, accounting, or tax matters. Avirum LLC assumes no liability for any actions taken based on information provided by the App.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">No Warranty: The App is provided 'as is' and 'as available' without warranties of any kind, express or implied.<br>No Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, Avirum LLC and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or other intangible losses, resulting from: your use or inability to use the App; any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in the App's data or features (including AI-generated content); unauthorized access to or alteration of your data; or any other matter relating to the App.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">7. User Data and Privacy</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">The App may collect and store data you provide, including transaction details and receipt images. Data is stored locally on your device and, if enabled, in your iCloud account. Some features may require secure transmission to Avirum LLC's servers or third-party services for processing (e.g., AI receipt extraction). Please review our Privacy Policy for details on data collection, use, and storage.<br><br>You have the right to delete all your data at any time through the app's Settings. The 'Delete All My Data' option will permanently remove all local and iCloud data associated with your account.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">8. Subscription and Payments</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">The App offers a free trial and paid subscription options. Subscriptions are managed via your Apple ID and the App Store. All payments, renewals, and cancellations are handled by Apple. Please refer to Apple's terms for details. If your subscription lapses, any linked bank account(s) will be automatically disconnected after 30 days of inactivity to prevent further data access and related service fees.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">9. Automated Bank Connection Limits and Fair Use</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">To keep platform costs sustainable, Ledgify limits each account to a maximum of two active bank connections and one manual "Sync Now" request per 24-hour period. Repeatedly linking and removing the same or different bank accounts in a manner that exceeds normal consumer usage may be deemed abusive. We reserve the right to temporarily suspend Plaid connectivity for up to seven (7) days, or permanently, if unusual or excessive activity is detected. You will remain able to access the rest of the App during any suspension period.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Attempting to circumvent these limits (for example, by reinstalling the App or creating duplicate Items) also violates this Fair-Use section and may lead to immediate termination under Section 11 above.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Avirum LLC reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any part thereof at any time, with or without notice.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Avirum LLC may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that it believes violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or the business.</p>
